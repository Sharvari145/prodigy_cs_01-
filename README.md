# SHARVARI SAWANT prodigy_cs_01
🔐 Caesar Cipher Encoder & Decoder (Python)

This is a simple Python script that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the **Caesar Cipher algorithm. It takes a message and a numeric shift value as input and shifts each letter accordingly to perform encryption or decryption.

💡 Features

* Supports both encryption and decryption.
* Accepts custom shift values.
* Keeps non-alphabet characters unchanged.
* Works with both uppercase and lowercase input.

 🖥️ Sample Terminal Output Explained

In the terminal screenshot:

 1️⃣ Encryption Example
Input Message:sharvarisawant
Shift Value: 10
Encrypted Output: crkbkfbksckgxd

> Each letter in the original message is shifted 10 positions forward in the alphabet.

2️⃣ Decryption Example

Input Message: `Dipalisawant`
Shift Value:`10`
Decrypted Output:`Tyfbyiqmqdj`

> The program attempted to shift each letter 10 positions backward to retrieve the original message. Note: It seems this was run on a different name (`Dipalisawant`) instead of the encrypted one from earlier, so the decrypted message won't match the original encryption result.
